TeeTyme is a website where you can record your golf statistics. You start by creating a player and entering all of their 
information into the database. Then you select your player and golf course then you input the date, time, and strokes 
when you played the round. You can also add golf courses if the one you are looking for isnt in the database. There is
also an option to upload a picture and view the picture when ever you would like.
